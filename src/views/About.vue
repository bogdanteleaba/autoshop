                            <div class="text">AutoShop has over 90% prompted brand awareness with consumers, and attracts over 49 million cross platform visits each month. The audience is not only large but highly engaged with a 76% share of minutes spent across automotive classified sites. 

The marketplace also hosts the largest pool of vehicle sellers (listing more than 450,000 cars each day). Over 80% of UK automotive retailers advertise on autotrader.co.uk.

An overview of our business
Our purpose is to lead the future of the UK's digital automotive marketplace. We aim to improve the process of buying and selling vehicles in the UK, by continually evolving the ecosystem to provide a better experience for consumers, retailers and manufacturers alike.

AutoShop is a 100% digital business. Starting life as a local classified magazine in 1977, weâ€™ve grown and evolved alongside our customers. In 2013, we successfully completed the transition from a print title and became a fully digital marketplace. Our rich history gives us nearly 40 years of brand heritage and trust - unusual among online companies.

AutoShop listed on the London Stock Exchange in March 2015 and is now a member of the FTSE 100 Index.
